Twickertail's masterwork, the Maze Condominiums, showcases revolutionary features like rainwater collection furrows and paw-print solar panels. Citizens are chattering excitedly about these newfound architectural gems. Local restaurateur Patty Paws exclaims, 'It's like our city got a whiff of fresh air! These buildings have really nibbled on the edge of innovation.'
